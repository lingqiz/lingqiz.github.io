<td align="left"><p>Hi, this is Lingqi, wellcome to my website!</p>
<p>I am a 4th year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania working with <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~astocker/lab/index.php">Alan Stocker</a> and <a href="https://color.psych.upenn.edu/">David Brainard</a>
in the <a href="https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu">Department of Psychology</a> and the <a href="http://cni.upenn.edu/">Computational Neuroscience Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>I did my undergraduate in Computer Science, 
at <a href="https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/">Southern University of Science and Technology</a>, which is newly established in 2011 at Shenzhen, China.
(<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/chinese-university-wins-degree-of-freedom-1.10631">Short story about our university</a>)</p>
<p>Previously I worked at <a href="https://shamslab.psych.ucla.edu">Multisensory Perception Lab</a> at University of 
California, Los Angeles with Professor <a href="https://www.psych.ucla.edu/faculty/page/lshams">Ladan Shams</a>, 
where I study the computational principle behind multisensory integration 
(<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000943">Bayesian causal inference</a>).
I've also spent some time working with Professor <a href="https://www.erlichlab.org/">Jeffrey Erlich</a> at New York University Shanghai,
learning computational modeling of rodents behavior. </p>

<h2>Research Interests </h2>
<p>I am interested in how the brain works from a computational perspective. <br /></p>
<p>Right now, my research focuses on how regularities in the generative structure of our visual world shape our sensory system. This consists of mainly two aspects: <br /></p>
<p>1) Efficient coding, which studies how the brain should optimize its representation to maximize the amount of information transmission, often under realistic biological constraint; And <br />
2) Bayesian inference, which studies if and what prior regularities the brain makes use of to solve ambiguous inference problem. <br /></p>
<p>I am particularly interested in studying these questions in the context of complex, naturalistic tasks, to understand the extent to which our brain is indeed &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; and its limitations when facing challenging inference problem.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>Despite being deeply intrigued by the mystery of the brain, I still keep some of the engineer part of myself :) I'm interested in <a href="https://probmods.org/">Probabilistic Programming Language</a>, generally Functional Programming, and Computer Graphics. 
I belief a &ldquo;good&rdquo; theory of the brain should be expressed in the language of mathematics and computation (i.e., a computer program).
I'm also interested in Philosophy of Mind such as the &ldquo;hard problem of consciousness&rdquo;.</p>
