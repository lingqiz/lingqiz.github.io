Hi, this is Lingqi, wellcome to my website!

I'm a first year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania currently doing lab rotation with [http://burgelab.psych.upenn.edu/research/Home.html Professor Johannes Burge], 
in the [https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu Department of Psychology] and the [http://cni.upenn.edu/ Computational Neuroscience Initiative].

I did my undergrad in Computer Science and Technology, 
at Southern University of Science and Technology, which is newly established in 2011 at Shenzhen, China.
([http://www.nature.com/news/chinese-university-wins-degree-of-freedom-1.10631  Short story about our university])

Previously I worked at [https://shamslab.psych.ucla.edu  Multisensory Perception Lab] at University of 
California, Los Angeles with Professor [https://www.psych.ucla.edu/faculty/page/lshams Ladan Shams], 
where I study the computational principle behind multisensory integration 
([http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000943 Bayesian causal inference]). 
I've also spent some time working with Professor [https://www.erlichlab.org/ Jeffrey Erlich] at New York University Shanghai,
learning computational modeling of rodents behavior. 

== Research Interests 
Iâ€™m interested in how the brain works from a computational perspective. 
Using engineering tools and ideas such as Bayesian Statistics (Machine Learning), Information Theory and Reinforcement Learning, we can formalize
normative principles governing perception, cognition, and goal-directed behavior, which in turn provide us with testable predictions at both behavioral and 
implementation (physiological) level. Conversely, by observing the how minds and machines solve the same problem 
differently, I ask questions about how insights into brain and human behavior could inform the research of artificial intelligence.

- Computational Cognitive Science 
- Bayesian Inference (Generative Model)
- Reinforcement Learning

== Miscellaneous
Despite being deeply intrigued by the mystery of the brain, I still keep some of the engineer part of myself :) 
I'm interested in [https://probmods.org/ Probabilistic Programming Language] and generally Functional Programming, 
and also parallel programming such as CUDA. I'm also interested in Philosophy of Mind such as the "hard problem of consciousness".
