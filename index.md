<p>Hi, this is Lingqi, wellcome to my website!</p>
<p>I’m a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science, 
at South University of Science and Technology of China, which is newly established in 2011 at Shenzhen, China.
(<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/chinese-university-wins-degree-of-freedom-1.10631">Short story about our university</a>)</p>
<p>I'm currently a visiting student at <a href="https://shamslab.psych.ucla.edu">Multisensory Perception Lab</a> at University of 
California, Los Angeles with Professor <a href="https://www.psych.ucla.edu/faculty/page/lshams">Ladan Shams</a>, 
where I study the computational principle behind multisensory integration 
(<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000943">Bayesian causal inference</a>). 
Previously I have been working with Professor <a href="https://www.erlichlab.org/">Jeffrey Erlich</a> at New York University Shanghai 
on computational modeling of rodents behavior,  and with Professor <a href="http://www.mjrlab.org/">Malte Rasch</a> at Beijing Normal Unversity on human face 
perception. I also closely interact with Professor <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~qiwang/">Qi Wang</a> during my undergradaute, whose guidance had a significant influence on me doing great science. </p>
<h2>Research Interests (see reseach page for details)</h2>
<p>I’m interested in how the brain works from a computational perspective. 
Using engineering tools and ideas such as Bayesian Statistics (Machine Learning), Information Theory and Reinforcement Learning, we can formalize
normative principles governing perception, cognition, and goal-directed behavior, which in turn provide us with testable predictions at both behavioral and 
implementation (physiological) level. Conversely, by observing the how minds and machines solve the same problem 
differently, I ask questions about how insights into brain and human behavior could inform the research of artificial intelligence. 
I also maintain active interests in dynamical system model and control theory.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>Despite being deeply intrigued by the mystery of the brain, I still keep some of the engineer part of myself :) 
I'm interested in <a href="https://probmods.org/">Probabislitc Programming Language</a> and generally Functional Programming, 
and also parallel programming such as CUDA. I'm also interested in Philosophy of Mind such as the discussion 
related to free will and the &ldquo;hard problem&rdquo; of consciousness.</p>
